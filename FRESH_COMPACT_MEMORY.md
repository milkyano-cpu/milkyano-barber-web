# FRESH COMPACT MEMORY

**IMPORTANT**: Instead of using `/compact`, store session summaries here for persistent memory across chats. Update this file at the beginning and end of each session with work context, accomplishments, and next steps. This ensures critical information persists beyond ephemeral conversations.

## Enhanced Authentication System - Completed (June 23, 2025)

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Dedicated Authentication Pages
- **Register Page** (`/register`): Standalone registration with clean UI
  - Form validation with Zod
  - Password visibility toggle
  - OTP verification modal
  - Redirects to original destination after success
  
- **Login Page** (`/login`): Professional login experience
  - Phone number + password authentication
  - Remember me checkbox
  - Link to registration
  - Social login placeholders (disabled)

- **Account Page** (`/account`): User profile management
  - Three tabs: Profile, Bookings, Security
  - Edit profile information
  - View booking history (placeholder)
  - Logout functionality

#### 2. Improved Navigation & UI
- **Header Updates**:
  - Login/Sign Up buttons for guests
  - User dropdown menu for authenticated users
  - Quick access to account settings
  
- **Booking Flow Improvements**:
  - Removed inline registration from booking
  - Clean "Create an Account" CTA for new users
  - Auto-fill for authenticated users
  - Phone number validation with login prompt

#### 3. Better User Experience
- **Clear User Flows**:
  - Registration: Dedicated page → OTP → Success
  - Login: Simple phone + password
  - Booking: Optional authentication with benefits shown
  
- **Visual Enhancements**:
  - Consistent dark theme styling
  - Icon usage for better visual hierarchy
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Responsive design

### Technical Implementation
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Mock authentication API with full flow
- LocalStorage for auth persistence
- Context API for state management
- TypeScript for type safety

### Files Created/Modified
**New Files**:
- `/src/pages/auth/Register.tsx`
- `/src/pages/auth/Login.tsx` 
- `/src/pages/auth/Account.tsx`

**Modified Files**:
- `/src/routes.tsx` - Added auth routes
- `/src/components/web/WebHeader.tsx` - Added login/signup buttons, user dropdown
- `/src/components/book/BookContactInfo.tsx` - Simplified, removed inline registration
- `/src/components/auth/LoginModal.tsx` - Added registration link
- `/src/App.tsx` - Added AuthProvider and Toaster

### Next Steps
1. Backend Implementation:
   - Create actual auth endpoints
   - Integrate SMS provider for OTP
   - Implement password hashing
   - Add rate limiting

2. Future Enhancements:
   - Social login integration
   - Booking history in account page
   - Email verification option
   - Password reset flow
   - Two-factor authentication

### Testing Notes
- Mock API enabled by default (USE_MOCK_API = true)
- Test accounts: +61412345678 (password: password123)
- OTP codes logged to console in development
- All forms have proper validation

The authentication system is now much more user-friendly with dedicated pages, clear navigation, and a professional UI that matches the barbershop's brand.
